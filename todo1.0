ElementBase sub_items not subitem?

*XMPP needs to use JID class instead of lots of fields.

BaseXMPP set_jid, makeIqQuery, getjidresource, getjidbare not needed

Why CamelCase and underscore_names? Document semantics.

conn_tests and sleekxmpp/tests and sleekxmpp/xmlstresm/test.* -> convert to either unit tests, or at least put in same place

Update setup.py - github url, version #

scheduler needs unit tests

ClientXMPP stream:features handler should use new state machine

Write stream tests for startls, features, etc.
